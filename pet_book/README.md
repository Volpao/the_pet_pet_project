| The Pet Pet  Project 	| After having collected roughly 1500 images per class, we split them among train, validation and test and create the relevant image generators to  provide  our model with image batches. For each model we test we properly preprocess images. The one which gave us the best accuracy is tested on test images as well  as on some selected single images. We analyze the obtained results. 	| 1. We shall create a model to properly predict the breed of a dog  in the image. 	| *Matplotlib *Tensorflow *Pillow *Sklearn *Keras *Numpy *OpenCV 	|
